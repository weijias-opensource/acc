Extracting P-wave reflections between the free surface and the lithospheric discontinuities to image the subsurface structures.

### Installing

There are two ways:

The first is downloading the code via git clone command.


```
>>> git clone 
```

and enter the main directroy of the package where the `setup.py` file is, then excute

>>> python setup.py install
```
.

The second is just simply executing the command of 

```
pip install acc
```


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Tutorials

Please go the the example directory and run `>>> sh run.sh` for a simple example of the Warramungga array data.

More tutorials will be added later.


## Deployment

Idealy the package can be running on all operating systems, including Windows, Mac and Linux. But the package is well tested on Ubuntu Linux (19.04).
